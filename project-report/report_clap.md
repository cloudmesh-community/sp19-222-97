# 👏 Tetris 👏 Score 👏 Analysis 👏 Server 👏 --- 👏 | 👏 Zach 👏 Levy 👏 | 👏 zwlevy@iu.edu 👏 | 👏 Indiana 👏 University 👏 | 👏 hid: 👏 sp19-222-97 👏 | 👏 github:[:cloud:](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/sp19-222-97) 👏 | 👏 code:[:cloud:](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/sp19-222-97/tree/master/project-code) 👏 ## 👏 Abstract 👏 --- 👏 The 👏 purpose 👏 of 👏 this 👏 project 👏 is 👏 an 👏 inquiry 👏 on 👏 statistical 👏 analysis 👏 of 👏 various 👏 facets 👏 of 👏 the 👏 classic 👏 arcade 👏 video 👏 game, 👏 Tetris. 👏 Using 👏 data 👏 recorded 👏 from 👏 players 👏 in 👏 an 👏 application 👏 as 👏 well 👏 as 👏 analyzing 👏 the 👏 qualities 👏 between 👏 various 👏 factors 👏 such 👏 as 👏 playtime, 👏 score, 👏 level, 👏 and 👏 more, 👏 the 👏 aim 👏 is 👏 to 👏 possibly 👏 extract 👏 meaningful 👏 relationships 👏 and 👏 evaluate 👏 them 👏 using 👏 standard 👏 regression 👏 models. 👏 ## 👏 Introduction 👏 --- 👏 Released 👏 originally 👏 on 👏 the 👏 Electronika 👏 60 👏 in 👏 the 👏 USSR 👏 on 👏 June 👏 6, 👏 1984, 👏 Tetris 👏 has 👏 came 👏 from 👏 a 👏 small 👏 programming 👏 project 👏 from 👏 Soviet 👏 game 👏 designer 👏 Alexey 👏 Pajitnov 👏 to 👏 one 👏 of 👏 the 👏 most 👏 world-renowned 👏 puzzle 👏 video 👏 games 👏 of 👏 all 👏 time. 👏 Although 👏 deviations 👏 have 👏 spawned 👏 from 👏 the 👏 game, 👏 the 👏 primary 👏 rules 👏 of 👏 Tetris 👏 are 👏 rather 👏 simple. 👏 Blocks, 👏 arranged 👏 into 👏 sequences 👏 of 👏 four 👏 called 👏 tetrominoes, 👏 move 👏 vertically 👏 from 👏 top 👏 to 👏 bottom. 👏 The 👏 player 👏 can 👏 reposition 👏 and 👏 reorient 👏 the 👏 blocks, 👏 and 👏 the 👏 goal 👏 is 👏 to 👏 get 👏 a 👏 set 👏 of 👏 blocks 👏 all 👏 on 👏 a 👏 bottom 👏 line, 👏 in 👏 which 👏 the 👏 blocks 👏 will 👏 disappear 👏 and 👏 add 👏 to 👏 the 👏 score. 👏 After 👏 many 👏 of 👏 these 👏 occur, 👏 the 👏 game 👏 will 👏 speed 👏 up, 👏 making 👏 it 👏 harder 👏 to 👏 arrange 👏 blocks 👏 correctly. 👏 The 👏 game 👏 is 👏 over 👏 when 👏 the 👏 blocks 👏 reach 👏 to 👏 top 👏 of 👏 the 👏 screen. 👏  👏 Tetris 👏 is 👏 one 👏 of 👏 the 👏 most 👏 widely 👏 renowned 👏 video 👏 games 👏 of 👏 our 👏 time. 👏 Ported 👏 to 👏 a 👏 wide 👏 variety 👏 of 👏 platforms, 👏 it 👏 has 👏 become 👏 a 👏 part 👏 of 👏 popular 👏 video 👏 game 👏 culture 👏 and 👏 has 👏 sold 👏 millions 👏 of 👏 copies. 👏 Psychological 👏 studies 👏 done 👏 on 👏 people 👏 who 👏 play 👏 the 👏 game 👏 have 👏 lead 👏 to 👏 the 👏 discovery 👏 that 👏 people 👏 who 👏 play 👏 for 👏 prolonged 👏 periods 👏 of 👏 time 👏 may 👏 see 👏 mild 👏 remote 👏 memories 👏 of 👏 the 👏 images 👏 of 👏 the 👏 tetrominoes 👏 moving. 👏 [@article:1] 👏 Additionally, 👏 some 👏 studies 👏 suggest 👏 that 👏 Tetris 👏 may 👏 help 👏 reduce 👏 mental 👏 stress 👏 and 👏 help 👏 individuals 👏 cope 👏 with 👏 post-traumatic 👏 stress 👏 disorder. 👏 [@website:1] 👏 ## 👏 Design 👏 --- 👏 The 👏 primary 👏 design 👏 for 👏 this 👏 project 👏 comes 👏 in 👏 two 👏 stages: 👏  👏 1) 👏 The 👏 creation 👏 of 👏 a 👏 regression 👏 model 👏 that 👏 most 👏 suitable 👏 fits 👏 the 👏 dataset. 👏 This 👏 should 👏 most 👏 likely 👏 be 👏 a 👏 linear 👏 regression 👏 model 👏 or 👏 a 👏 data 👏 tree. 👏 2) 👏 The 👏 creation 👏 of 👏 a 👏 RESTful 👏 server 👏 that 👏 could 👏 retrieve 👏 the 👏 raw 👏 data 👏 sets, 👏 perform 👏 analysis, 👏 and 👏 return 👏 the 👏 data 👏 to 👏 a 👏 requested 👏 user. 👏  👏 The 👏 first 👏 part 👏 of 👏 the 👏 project 👏 required 👏 me 👏 to 👏 program 👏 a 👏 way 👏 to 👏 retrieve 👏 the 👏 transcribed 👏 data. 👏 Due 👏 to 👏 the 👏 data 👏 on 👏 the 👏 website 👏 being 👏 only 👏 images 👏 of 👏 spreadsheets 👏 rather 👏 then 👏 the 👏 spreadsheets 👏 themselves, 👏 this 👏 was 👏 neccessary. 👏 [@website:2] 👏 By 👏 importing 👏 the 👏 Python 👏 libraries 👏 csv 👏 and 👏 requests, 👏 the 👏 program 👏 can 👏 retrieve 👏 this 👏 data 👏 from 👏 a 👏 Google 👏 Drive 👏 downloadable 👏 link 👏 as 👏 TETRIS_DOWNLOAD.csv. 👏 This 👏 data 👏 set 👏 can 👏 be 👏 found 👏 [here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ndBqB24w8OnpZmTZTU_Ey2iHdbgxDZgJeuYc66tzhTI){#sec:tetris-data} 👏  👏 The 👏 analysis 👏 of 👏 the 👏 data 👏 was 👏 first 👏 done 👏 with 👏 the 👏 usage 👏 of 👏 a 👏 linear 👏 regression 👏 model. 👏 For 👏 this, 👏 I 👏 took 👏 the 👏 features 👏 to 👏 be 👏 year, 👏 rounds 👏 won, 👏 and 👏 composite 👏 score. 👏 The 👏 label 👏 in 👏 question 👏 was 👏 the 👏 resulting 👏 ranking 👏 of 👏 players. 👏 The 👏 second 👏 model 👏 used 👏 was 👏 a 👏 data 👏 tree 👏 classifier. 👏 This 👏 would 👏 help 👏 with 👏 the 👏 previous 👏 linear 👏 regression 👏 model, 👏 since 👏 we 👏 can 👏 observe 👏 how 👏 the 👏 Gini 👏 coefficients 👏 - 👏 analytical 👏 resultants 👏 of 👏 data 👏 trees 👏 that 👏 help 👏 color 👏 the 👏 importance 👏 of 👏 certain 👏 variables 👏 - 👏 are 👏 resulted 👏 from 👏 the 👏 usage 👏 of 👏 a 👏 data 👏 tree. 👏  👏  👏 By 👏 usage 👏 of 👏 a 👏 data 👏 tree 👏 node 👏 to 👏 evaluate 👏 linear 👏 regression 👏 models, 👏 we 👏 can 👏 better 👏 understand 👏 which 👏 relationships 👏 between 👏 variables 👏 are 👏 meaningful 👏 and 👏 which 👏 are 👏 not. 👏 ## 👏 Architecture 👏 --- 👏 There 👏 are 👏 two 👏 primary 👏 structures 👏 within 👏 this 👏 experiment. 👏 The 👏 first 👏 is 👏 the 👏 linear 👏 regression 👏 model 👏 located 👏 within 👏 linear_regressor.py 👏 and 👏 data_tree.py. 👏 The 👏 first 👏 Python 👏 module 👏 retrieves 👏 data 👏 from 👏 the 👏 google 👏 drive 👏 link 👏 and 👏 downloads 👏 it 👏 locally, 👏 given 👏 the 👏 API 👏 implementation, 👏 can 👏 send 👏 over 👏 results 👏 of 👏 analysis 👏 on 👏 the 👏 data 👏 set. 👏 It 👏 gives 👏 five 👏 distinct 👏 graphs. 👏  👏  👏 1) 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Year 👏 2) 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Score 👏 3) 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Rounds 👏 Won 👏 4) 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Score 👏 - 👏 Adjusted 👏  👏 5) 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Rounds 👏 Won 👏 - 👏 Adjusted 👏  👏 As 👏 for 👏 the 👏 second 👏 module, 👏 data_tree.py, 👏 it 👏 will 👏 simply 👏 read 👏 the 👏 data 👏 and 👏 create 👏 a 👏 .dot 👏 chart 👏 from 👏 the 👏 results, 👏 which 👏 can 👏 be 👏 saved 👏 remotely 👏 just 👏 like 👏 the 👏 graphs 👏 within 👏 linear_regressor.py. 👏 Luckily, 👏 the 👏 handy 👏 Python 👏 library 👏 graphviz 👏 makes 👏 for 👏 easy 👏 use 👏 of 👏 creating 👏 the 👏 data 👏 tree 👏 to 👏 reflect 👏 the 👏 data 👏 used 👏 within 👏 this 👏 experiment. 👏 ## 👏 Dataset 👏 --- 👏 The 👏 data 👏 used 👏 within 👏 this 👏 project 👏 was 👏 primarily 👏 extrapolated 👏 from 👏 data 👏 of 👏 the 👏 winner 👏 results 👏 from 👏 the 👏 Tetris 👏 World 👏 Championships. 👏 Due 👏 to 👏 the 👏 fact 👏 that 👏 previous 👏 years 👏 represent 👏 data 👏 as 👏 only 👏 image 👏 screenshots 👏 of 👏 spreadsheets, 👏 the 👏 data 👏 had 👏 to 👏 be 👏 manually 👏 transcribed 👏 into 👏 other 👏 comma-separated 👏 value 👏 spreadsheets. 👏 Although 👏 painstaking, 👏 we 👏 managed 👏 to 👏 extract 👏 rank, 👏 year, 👏 rounds 👏 played, 👏 and 👏 composite 👏 score 👏 from 👏 the 👏 entries 👏 from 👏 2012-2018. 👏 ## 👏 Results 👏 --- 👏 To 👏 put 👏 the 👏 results 👏 into 👏 better 👏 interpration, 👏 there 👏 are 👏 various 👏 mathematical 👏 ideas 👏 that 👏 can 👏 help 👏 explain 👏 the 👏 actual 👏 importance 👏 or 👏 usefulness 👏 of 👏 relationships 👏 shown. 👏 Most 👏 importantly 👏 when 👏 it 👏 comes 👏 to 👏 our 👏 experiment 👏 is 👏 the 👏 following 👏 for 👏 linear 👏 regression 👏 models 👏 and 👏 data 👏 trees. 👏  👏 * 👏 __Correlation 👏 Coefficient.__ 👏 Denoted 👏 by 👏 _R_, 👏 a 👏 correlation 👏 coefficient 👏 measures 👏 the 👏 strength 👏 of 👏 linear 👏 relationships 👏 of 👏 a 👏 scatter 👏 plot. 👏  👏  👏 The 👏 following 👏 table 👏 shows 👏 various 👏 other 👏 points 👏 of 👏 data, 👏 including 👏 the 👏 _R_ 👏 value 👏 as 👏 well. 👏  👏 : 👏 Linear 👏 Regressor 👏 {#tbl:lin-reg} 👏  👏  👏 | 👏 Graph 👏 Type 👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏 | 👏 Slope 👏  👏  👏  👏 | 👏 Intercept 👏 | 👏 R 👏 Value 👏  👏  👏 | 👏 R 👏 Squared 👏 | 👏 P 👏 Value 👏  👏 | 👏 Standard 👏 Error 👏 | 👏 |---------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------------| 👏 | 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Year 👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏 | 👏 0.479999 👏 | 👏 -950.059 👏  👏 | 👏 0.100040 👏  👏 | 👏 0.010008 👏  👏 | 👏 0.128674 👏 | 👏 0.128674 👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏 | 👏 | 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Score 👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏 | 👏 -8.47387 👏 | 👏 24.6477 👏  👏  👏 | 👏 -0.492092 👏 | 👏 0.242064 👏  👏 | 👏 1.49504 👏  👏 | 👏 0.000009 👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏 | 👏 | 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Rounds 👏 Won 👏 | 👏 -6.92834 👏 | 👏 29.9115 👏  👏  👏 | 👏 -0.896032 👏 | 👏 0.802873 👏  👏 | 👏 4.60790 👏  👏 | 👏 0.226367 👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏  👏 | 👏  👏 * 👏 __Gini 👏 Coefficient.__ 👏 Denoted 👏 by 👏 it's 👏 name, 👏 _Gini_, 👏 Gini 👏 coefficients 👏 are 👏 used 👏 with 👏 decision 👏 tree 👏 algorithms 👏 to 👏 measure 👏 the 👏 effectiveness 👏 of 👏 branches 👏 in 👏 a 👏 data 👏 tree. 👏 In 👏 a 👏 good 👏 model, 👏 we 👏 expect 👏 these 👏 to 👏 be 👏 closer 👏 to 👏 zero 👏 towards 👏 the 👏 leaves 👏 of 👏 a 👏 data 👏 tree. 👏  👏 With 👏 the 👏 correlation 👏 coefficients 👏 of 👏 the 👏 graph, 👏 most 👏 of 👏 the 👏 relationships 👏 we 👏 found 👏 did 👏 not 👏 have 👏 much 👏 important, 👏 at 👏 least 👏 until 👏 the 👏 data 👏 was 👏 adjusted 👏 to 👏 better 👏 fit 👏 a 👏 linear 👏 model. 👏 This 👏 is 👏 what 👏 lead 👏 to 👏 the 👏 necessity 👏 of 👏 adjusting 👏 the 👏 graph 👏 for 👏 the 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Score 👏 and 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Rounds 👏 Won 👏 graphs. 👏 As 👏 a 👏 result, 👏 the 👏 correlation 👏 coefficients 👏 for 👏 the 👏 graphs 👏 can 👏 be 👏 found 👏 below: 👏  👏 ![Data 👏 Tree](images/dt.svg){#fig:data-tree} 👏  👏 For 👏 the 👏 Gini 👏 coefficients 👏 of 👏 the 👏 data 👏 tree 👏 representation, 👏 it 👏 was 👏 found 👏 that 👏 at 👏 the 👏 root 👏 node 👏 that 👏 it 👏 was 👏 precisely 👏 0.238 👏 for 👏 a 👏 sample 👏 size 👏 of 👏 232 👏 samples. 👏 Moving 👏 towards 👏 the 👏 true 👏 side 👏 of 👏 the 👏 graph, 👏 we 👏 found 👏 that 👏 Gini 👏 coefficients 👏 gradualy 👏 become 👏 closer 👏 to 👏 zero, 👏 with 👏 last 👏 branching 👏 node 👏 to 👏 only 👏 contain 👏 a 👏 Gini 👏 coefficient 👏 of 👏 0.037. 👏 It 👏 should 👏 be 👏 noted 👏 that 👏 the 👏 data 👏 tree 👏 node 👏 is 👏 very 👏 lopsided. 👏 This 👏 could 👏 possibly 👏 indicate 👏 that 👏 the 👏 cost 👏 per 👏 each 👏 decision 👏 is 👏 rather 👏 high. 👏 ## 👏 Conclusion 👏 --- 👏 The 👏 deductions 👏 made 👏 from 👏 both 👏 of 👏 these 👏 experiments 👏 must 👏 be 👏 approached 👏 differently, 👏 since 👏 they 👏 are 👏 seperate 👏 models. 👏 According 👏 to 👏 the 👏 chart, 👏 we 👏 can 👏 see 👏 that 👏 the 👏 _R_ 👏 squared 👏 value 👏 for 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Year 👏 became 👏 0.010008, 👏 for 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Score 👏 it 👏 was 👏 0.242064, 👏 and 👏 for 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Rounds 👏 Won 👏 it 👏 was 👏 0.802873. 👏 [@:lin-reg]. 👏 This 👏 should 👏 come 👏 as 👏 no 👏 real 👏 suprise, 👏 since 👏 we 👏 expect 👏 that 👏 any 👏 person 👏 who 👏 won 👏 more 👏 rounds 👏 has 👏 a 👏 higher 👏 rank 👏 then 👏 the 👏 others 👏 who 👏 did 👏 not 👏 win. 👏 We 👏 know 👏 that 👏 from 👏 the 👏 rather 👏 low 👏 values 👏 comparatively 👏 for 👏 Score 👏 and 👏 Year 👏 that 👏 there 👏 does 👏 not 👏 seem 👏 to 👏 be 👏 a 👏 strong 👏 linear 👏 relationship 👏 between 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Year 👏 and 👏 Rank 👏 vs. 👏 Score. 👏  👏 As 👏 for 👏 the 👏 data 👏 tree 👏 model, 👏 it 👏 was 👏 discovered 👏 that 👏 the 👏 Gini 👏 coefficients 👏 for 👏 the 👏 model 👏 were 👏 indeed 👏 closer 👏 to 👏 zero 👏 but 👏 that 👏 the 👏 data 👏 tree 👏 itself 👏 was 👏 heavily 👏 lopsided. 👏 [@:data-tree] 👏 This 👏 suggests 👏 that 👏 although 👏 their 👏 may 👏 be 👏 vague 👏 linear 👏 relationship 👏 when 👏 classifying 👏 the 👏 elements 👏 of 👏 the 👏 data 👏 tree, 👏 it 👏 has 👏 high 👏 cost 👏 for 👏 it's 👏 usage, 👏 meaning 👏 again 👏 it 👏 may 👏 not 👏 fit 👏 to 👏 be 👏 a 👏 very 👏 useful 👏 model. 👏 The 👏 Gini 👏 coefficient 👏 at 👏 the 👏 first 👏 branch 👏 was 👏 0.238, 👏 and 👏 the 👏 Gini 👏 coefficient 👏 at 👏 the 👏 last 👏 one 👏 was 👏 0.37. 👏 Pruning 👏 of 👏 unnessecary 👏 leaves, 👏 mainly 👏 any 👏 branches 👏 whose 👏 Gini 👏 coefficients 👏 are 👏 already 👏 zero, 👏 could 👏 help 👏 this 👏 matter. 👏 ##
